abstract ={The family of autoregressive integrated moving-average processes, widely used in time series analysis, is generalized by permitting the degree of differencing to take fractional values. The fractional differencing operator is defined as an infinite binomial series expansion in powers of the backward-shift operator. Fractionally differenced processes exhibit long-term persistence and antipersistence; the dependence between observations a long time span apart decays much more slowly with time span than is the case with the more commonly studied time series models. Long-term persistent processes have applications in economics and hydrology; compared to existing models of long-term persistence, the family of models introduced here offers much greater flexibility in the simultaneous modelling of the short-term and long-term behaviour of a time series.},

We find that these timeseries show scaling behavior which is quantified by computing various scaling exponents. We demonstrate that mentally active zones are one-to-one related to large exponents, or equivalently, to highly temporally correlated processes, while mentally inactive zones are well described by a simple random walk model. Activation maps of scaling exponents are presented and compared to standard results in fMRI. In contrast to standard model-based activation analyses no prior knowledge of the experimental stimulation paradigm has to be assumed for extracting activation patterns from fMRI timeseries. We mention consequences of persistence in fMRI timeseries for standard statistical analysis. "

title="Fractal character of the electrocardiogram: Distinguishing heart-failure and normal patients",
journal="Annals of Biomedical Engineering",
volume="24",
number="2",
pages="269--293",
abstract="Statistical analysis of the sequence of heartbeats can provide information about the state of health of the heart. We used a variety of statistical measures to identify the form of the point process that describes the human heartbeat. These measures are based on both intervent intervals and counts, and include the intervent-interval histogram, interval-based periodogram, rescaled range analysis, the event-number histogram, Fano-factor, Allan Factor, and generalized-rate-based periodogram. All of these measures have been applied to data from both normal and heart-failure patients, and various surrogate versions thereof. The results show that almost all of the interevent-interval and the long-term counting statistics differ in statistically significant ways for the two classes of data. Several measures reveal 1/f-type fluctuations (long-duration power-law correlation). The analysis that we have conducted suggests the use of a conveniently calculated, quantitative index, based on the Allan factor, that indicates whether a particular patient does or does not suffer from heart failure. The Allan factor turns out to be particularly useful because it is easily calculated and is jointly responsive to both short-term and long-term characteristics of the heartbeat time series. A phase-space reconstruction based on the generalized heart rate is used to obtain a putative attractor's capacity dimension. Though the dependence of this dimension on the embedding dimension is consistent with that of a low-dimensional dynamical system (with a larger apparent dimension for normal subjects), surrogate-data analysis shows that identical behavior emerges from temporal correlation in a stochastic process. We present simulated results for a purely stochastic integrate-and-fire model, comprising a fractal-Gaussian-noise kernel, in which the sequence of heartbeats is determined by level crossings of fractional Brownian motion. This model characterizes the statistical behavior of the human electrocardiogram remarkably well, properly accounting for the behavior of all of the measures studied, over all time scales.",

	Abstract = {Neural systems adapt to changes in stimulus statistics. However, it is not known how stimuli with complex temporal dynamics drive the dynamics of adaptation and the resulting firing rate. For single neurons, it has often been assumed that adaptation has a single time scale. Here, we show that single rat neocortical pyramidal neurons adapt with a time scale that depends on the time scale of changes in stimulus statistics. This multiple time scale adaptation is consistent with fractional order differentiation, such that the neuron's firing rate is a fractional derivative of slowly varying stimulus parameters. Biophysically, even though neuronal fractional differentiation effectively yields adaptation with many time scales, we find that its implementation requires only a few, properly balanced known adaptive mechanisms. Fractional differentiation provides single neurons with a fundamental and general computation that can contribute to efficient information processing, stimulus anticipation, and frequency independent phase shifts of oscillatory neuronal firing.},

In addition, the analysis of complex networks in different scales are widely used in physics community. This can provide detailed insights into the intrinsic properties of networks. In this study, we focus on the identification of controlling regions in cortical networks of cats� brain in microscopic, mesoscopic and macroscopic scales, based on single-objective evolutionary computation methods. The problem is investigated by considering two measures of controllability separately. The impact of the number of driver nodes on controllability is revealed and the properties of controlling nodes are shown in a statistical way. Our results show that the statistical properties of the controlling nodes display a concave or convex shape with an increase of the allowed number of controlling nodes, revealing a transition in choosing driver nodes from the areas with a large degree to the areas with a low degree. Interestingly, the community Auditory in cats� brain, which has sparse connections with other communities, plays an important role in controlling the neuronal networks.</p>},

The structural controllability is a generalization of the traditional controllability concept for dynamical systems and purely based on the interconnection relation between the state variables and inputs through non-zero elements in the state matrices. In order to illustrate such a relationship, two kinds of graphic representations of switched linear systems are proposed, based on which graph theory-based necessary and sufficient characterizations of the structural controllability for switched linear systems are presented. Finally, the paper concludes with discussions on the results and future work. "

@article{rezatac07,
    abstract = {{This paper provides a theoretical framework for analysis of consensus algorithms for multi-agent networked systems with an emphasis on the role of directed information flow, robustness to changes in network topology due to link/node failures, time-delays, and performance guarantees. An overview of basic concepts of information consensus in networks and methods of convergence and performance analysis for the algorithms are provided. Our analysis framework is based on tools from matrix theory, algebraic graph theory, and control theory. We discuss the connections between consensus problems in networked dynamic systems and diverse applications including synchronization of coupled oscillators, flocking, formation control, fast consensus in small-world networks, Markov processes and gossip-based algorithms, load balancing in networks, rendezvous in space, distributed sensor fusion in sensor networks, and belief propagation. We establish direct connections between spectral and structural properties of complex networks and the speed of information diffusion of consensus algorithms. A brief introduction is provided on networked systems with nonlocal information flow that are considerably faster than distributed systems with lattice-type nearest neighbor interactions. Simulation results are presented that demonstrate the role of small-world effects on the speed of consensus algorithms and cooperative control of multivehicle formations}},

    abstract = {{The ultimate proof of our understanding of natural or technological systems is reflected in our ability to control them. Although control theory offers mathematical tools for steering engineered and natural systems towards a desired state, a framework to control complex self-organized systems is lacking. Here we develop analytical tools to study the controllability of an arbitrary complex directed network, identifying the set of driver nodes with time-dependent control that can guide the system's entire dynamics. We apply these tools to several real networks, finding that the number of driver nodes is determined mainly by the network's degree distribution. We show that sparse inhomogeneous networks, which emerge in many real complex systems, are the most difficult to control, but that dense and homogeneous networks can be controlled using a few driver nodes. Counterintuitively, we find that in both model and real systems the driver nodes tend to avoid the high-degree nodes.}},
