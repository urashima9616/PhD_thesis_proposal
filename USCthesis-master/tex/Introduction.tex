This chapter talks about motivation and applications of my work, and reviews previous research in the field.

\section{Motivations}
\label{sec:motivations}

Previous research\cite{Fisher:1954} \cite{Robbins:1951aa} \cite{Knight:1921} in the field of X has established that method A is very useful.
Another branch of researchers\cite{Wright:1921aa} \cite{Caratheodory:1909aa} \cite{Gibbs:1902} \cite{Clausius:1857} have figured out that method B could be better in certain occasions.
Here I propose a new method that gives results better than both types.
