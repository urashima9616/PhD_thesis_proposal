\chapter command.

Revision 1.7  2002/08/30 17:55:55  gerkey
changed (fixed) page margins and used \setstretch{2.0} to get "real"
double-spacing, per Yaser's comments.  except for spacing in lof and lot,
we're in compliance with 2002 guidelines.

Revision 1.6  2002/08/27 19:47:38  gerkey

      doublespacing between entries

fixed two user-reported bugs in order to adhere to the 2002 guidelines:

    is on the left, and the author name is on the right.

changed comments and docs

Revision 1.3  2001/11/08 01:25:29  gerkey
rejigged to start from v.2.3

Revision 3.0  2001/11/07  16:47:08  brian gerkey (gerkey@usc.edu)
Converted from a LaTeX 2.09 style to a LaTeX2e package

    - AFAIK, there are no changes to style, layout, or default options;
        just some hacking to adhere to the LaTeX2e package interface.

    - Usage is now as follows:
        \documentclass{report}
        \usepackage[<options>]{USCthesis}
        \begin{document}
     <options> can be any of the old options (e.g., proposal, fussy),
     as documented below.

Added some comments.  And corrected some spelling.

Revision 2.3  92/08/13  14:22:21  sdc
Added \universityname for easy use outside USC.  Also the
\if@techreport switch can be used to turn off the one-side-only
warning message (for better interface with the techreport style
option).  Placed a check for TeX-3.0 to allow an old TeX to work
without warnings.  Cleaned-up the code and comments a little.

Revision 2.2  92/06/29  10:59:15  sdc
Added standard file header for style.

Revision 2.1  91/02/09  00:54:08  cochran
Fixed bug in interaction with techreport.sty.

Revision 2.0  91/01/03  16:12:48  cochran
Merged divergent branches by cochran@iris.usc.edu (1.10) and by
tli@almaak.usc.edu (1.11); these are common up to revision 1.8.
Removed fix in 1.11 which added Reference List to the TOC since
this is handled by the \references command.

  Changes by tli@almaak.usc.edu:

    1.11 (90/09/23) Change title font to 12pt.  Change author's
    font to 12pt.  Fix Reference List so that it shows up in TOC.
    Break the way that appendices show up in TOC.

    1.10 (90/07/10) Added a hack to make it work with TeX 3.0.

    1.9 (90/01/30) Make subsubsections show up with numbered
    labels and in the TOC.

  Changes by cochran@iris.usc.edu:

    1.10 (90/12/29) Added commands and modified \title to allow
      multiple volume dissertations.  Fixed bug which caused the
      pagestyle of the TOC to be wrong if there were no
      preceeding prefacesections.

    1.9 (90/12/03)  Corrected title size to correspond to the
      University Publications statement that the "Title must be
      the same size as `FACULTY OF ...' and no bold print.  Also
      added an optional argument to the \pageleft command to
      allow the fine tuning of the gutter margin in the
      techreport style option.

Revision 1.8  89/09/15  19:39:11  tli
Change spacing in accordance with University Publications.

Revision 1.7  89/01/27  13:56:04  tli
Too much space after a saying.

Revision 1.6  89/01/26  14:01:20  tli
Added the saying environment.

Revision 1.5  88/11/02  10:42:47  cochran
Minor corrections and removal of unnecessary \makeatletter and
\makeatother.

Revision 1.4  88/10/20  11:58:38  cochran
Updated to allow the user more control over spacing to the "blue
lines," and to be in accordance with the USC Regulations for
Format and Presentation of Theses and Dissertations, published
March 1987.

Revision 1.3  88/03/16  10:49:19  cochran
Several small updates to \committee as suggested by peng@USC-IRIS.

Revision 1.1  88/03/05  20:04:51  cochran
Set penalties, and new margin and page sizes.  Fixed bug which
caused a wrong contents page for long lists of figures or tables.

Revision 1.0  87/03/05  18:29:34  cochran
Created by combining the best (?) features of the dissertation
styles written by Herb Barad @ USC-SIPI and Howard Trickey @
Stanford University.

NOTE:  This style assumes the existance of Stephen Page's
      `doublespace' package in addition to the standard
      LaTeX `report' document class.
